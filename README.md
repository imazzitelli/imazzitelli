👋 Hi, I'm Ignacio Mazzitelli

🧬 I'm a medical doctor and researcher with a PhD in Immunology, currently working as a postdoctoral fellow in immunoinformatics.

🎓 I'm also pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science to bridge my background in medicine with advanced analytics and machine learning.

💻 I work with:
- 🧪 Bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
- 🧠 Transcriptomic signature discovery and splicing analysis
- 📊 Public datasets (TCGA, GEO, CancerSCEM, etc.)
- 🤖 Machine learning applied to immunology and biomedicine

🔬 My current interests include:
- Unconventional immune regulation
- AI-assisted biomedical discovery
- Multi-omics integration for biomarker identification

🚀 On this GitHub you’ll find:
- R pipelines for RNA-seq analysis
- Single-cell workflows in Seurat
- Splicing and transcriptional signature scripts
- Biomedical ML experiments
